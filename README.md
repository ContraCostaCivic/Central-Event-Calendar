# Central-Event-Calendar
Central calendar of Walnut Creek events, including Arts &amp; Rec, City and non-profit activities.

Walnut Creek is lucky to have a wide range of community activities here and a variety of different providers. Our Arts and Rec Department receives many requests for a centralized calendar that lists City, non-profit, downtown, and other community organization events and allows those same audiences to list their entertainment activities. We have heard from many folks that there’s a lack of one location where people can find family friendly/event/entertainment activities and this could be in the form of a City-wide calendar that could be sorted by date/category/location, which we would then link to on the City’s website. This could be a particularly good challenge to tackle for those without programming experience, since you could build off of existing tools to help you aggregate multiple calendar feeds into one place.
